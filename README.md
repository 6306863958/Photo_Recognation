# Photo_Recognation
# 🧑‍💼 Celebrity Photo Recognition System using CNN
Built a CNN-based image classification model to recognize four public figures: Virat Kohli, Sachin Tendulkar, Sadhguru, and Sara Mohan.
Applied data augmentation techniques (rotation, flipping, zooming, etc.) to enhance dataset diversity and improve generalization.
Performed image preprocessing including resizing, normalization, and label encoding to prepare data for training.
The model effectively classifies images into one of the four classes, demonstrating strong performance in real-world conditions.
# 📸 Ideal for facial recognition tasks and learning computer vision fundamentals.
